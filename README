"blob" is a very minimal file format, designed to store arbitrary binary data.

It is not intended as a serialization format (such as BSON), which converts a
fully-formed object into something writable. Rather, it's intended to save a
stream of (mostly) raw binary data, whose structure is not known ahead of
time.

Included here is "blob.txt", which describes the format (such as it is), and
"blob.py" which is a basic Python library for reading/writing Blob files
